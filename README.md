ARC (Alkali Rydberg Calculator)
===============================


ARC (Alkali Rydberg Calculator)  is package of routines writen in Python, using object-oriented programming (OOP) to make modular, reusable and extendable collection of routines and data for performing useful calculations of single atom and two-atom properties, like level diagrams, interactions and transition strengths for alkali metal atoms.

For installation instructions and documentations see **documentation/index.html**.

For example IPython notebook in .html format see **documentation/Rydberg_atoms_a_primer.html** or for .ipynb format see **documentation/Rydberg_atoms_a_primer_notebook.ipynb**.

For online access to a selection of package functions see (web page arriving soon).

If you want to contribute to the project, please see **documentation/contribute.html**.
